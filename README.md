# AP BIO notes and Lab template as well as precalculus notes. Do what you will.

PDF Files are now located inside the [out](https://github.com/Yeet7/Notes/tree/master/out) and [labs](https://github.com/Yeet7/Notes/tree/master/Labs) folders respectively. 

Source code is the tex files if you want to make any changes. Create a pull request or branch if you want. The PDFs are the tex files compiled minus all the other .lof, toc, and useless files.

Anything that doesn't seem right, it probably isn't. Let me know. There is placeholders such as empty chapters, sections, or definitions. I'll get to them ~~never~~ eventually.

Notes are taken in order of learning. Certain sections may be blank as placeholders. Otherwise, they are in order.
