AP BIO notes and Lab template as well as Precalc notes. Do what you will.

Source code is the tex files if you want to make any changes. Create a pull request or branch if you want. The PDF's are the tex files compiled minus all of the other .lof, toc, and useless files.

Anything that doesn't seem right probably isn't. Let me know. There is placeholders such as empty chapters, sections, or definitions. I'll get to them eventually.

Notes are taken in order of learning. Certain sections may be blank as placeholders. Otherwise, they are in order.
