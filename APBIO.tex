\chapter{4: Cellular Communication}\label{ch:Cellular Comm.}

Cells must talk	to each other. They do this via signals or messengers, these are called ligands. Ligands is a general term for any signaling molecule.
Molecules made by some cells have an affect on others. For example, neurotransmitters communicate from one neuron to the next nerve cell or even muscle cell.
Cells in the immune system will either communicate with each other to help fight off an infection or cause an infected or cancerous cell to kill itself.
\qs{Whats the point?}{}
Recieving cells have proteins embedded in their membranes. These are called receptor proteins.

\section{Reception}\label{sec:reception}
\nt{The binding between signal molecule (ligand) and receptor is highly specific.}
\dfn{Conformational Change}{The process by which a protein changes shape via something attaching to said protein.}
\nt{There are two main types of membrane receptors.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item G-protein-coupled receptor
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Works with a G-protein (protein that turns on and off enzymes)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Ligand-gated ion chanel
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Open when ligand binds
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}}
\ex{How G-protein-coupled receptor's work.}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ligand (signal) attaches to GPCR protein (receptor) in the cellular membrane
	\item G protein (bound to the GPCR) becomes activated and moves to the inactive enzyme
	\item The previously inactive enzyme is now activated and produces the specific protein (cellular response).
\end{enumerate}}
\nt{Ligand Gated Ion Channels use channel proteins and are thus passive transport. They only use high $\rightarrow$ low gradients.}
\nt{\textbf{Intracellular Receptors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Most ligands are large and water-soluble and must bind to membrane proteins.
	\item Other ligands are hydrophobic and enter the cell (such as steroids)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item They bind to intracellular receptors
	\end{itemize}
	\item They \textit{usually} are hormones.
	\item They \textit{usually} activate genes.
\end{itemize}}

\dfn{Transduction}{Transduction of a signal is a multistep pathway (signal transduction pathway.)
\nt{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Advantages:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Can amplify a signal.
		\item Provide more opportunities for coordination and regulation
	\end{itemize}
	\item The signal is passed by proteins changing shape (usually due to phosphorylation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Phosporylation = adding a P$_{i}$ (from ATP)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}}
\nt{In this process;
\begin{itemize}
	\item A series of protein kinases add a phosphate to the next one in line, activating it
	\item Phosphatase enzymes then remove the phosphates (called protein phosphatases)
	\item Or in other words, 1 activates 2 which activates 3 which activates 4 until the response is made.
	\item Kinase's are called such because they \textit{phosphorylate} other molecules, not because they become phosphorylated.
\end{itemize}}

\dfn{Second Messengers}{Small, nonprotein, water-soluble molecules or ions that activate proteins inside of a cell.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Most common second messengers are cAMP and Ca$^{2+}$
	\item These are the things that start the cascade
\end{itemize}}

\nt{Response:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Activate/Deactivate an enzyme in the cytoplasm
    \item Turn on/off genes in the nucleus
\end{enumerate}}

\qs{Why so many steps?}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Amplification.
	\item Specificity.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A cell will only respond if it has the right receptor.
		\item A ligand MAY be able to bind to two different receptors made by two different cells.
		\item There, however, you would get two different responses.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
}
\nt{When the ligand leaves the receptor, the pathway stops. The signal response is terminated somewhat quickly.}

\nt{Feedbacks;
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Positive Feedback
	\begin{itemize}
		\item When the reaction enhances the original stimulus
		\item Amplification
		\item An end
	\end{itemize}
	\item Negative Feedback
	\begin{itemize}
		\item When the reaction counters the original stimulus
		\item Keep things in a narrow range.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}}

\section{The Cell Cycle}

\dfn{Phases:}{Interphase:G1, S, G2 | Mitosis.
Interphase:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item G1:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Growth and normal cell functions
	\end{itemize}
	\item S
	\begin{itemize}
		\item DNA Replication
	\end{itemize}
	\item G2
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Preperation for Mitosis
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
Phases of Mitosis:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prophase
	\item Prometaphase (Do not need to know. College Board does not accept it as an answer right now.)
	\item Metaphase
	\item Anaphase
	\item Telophase and Cytokinesis
\end{enumerate}
