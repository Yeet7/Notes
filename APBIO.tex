\chapter{4: Cellular Communication}\label{ch:Cellular Comm.}

Cells must talk	to each other. They do this via signals or messengers, these are called ligands. Ligands is a general term for any signaling molecule.
Molecules made by some cells have an affect on others. For example, neurotransmitters communicate from one neuron to the next nerve cell or even muscle cell.
Cells in the immune system will either communicate with each other to help fight off an infection or cause an infected or cancerous cell to kill itself.
\qs{Whats the point?}{}
Recieving cells have proteins embedded in their membranes. These are called receptor proteins.

\section{Reception}\label{sec:reception}
\nt{The binding between signal molecule (ligand) and receptor is highly specific.}
\dfn{Conformational Change}{The process by which a protein changes shape via something attaching to said protein.}
\nt{There are two main types of membrane receptors.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item G-protein-coupled receptor
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Works with a G-protein (protein that turns on and off enzymes)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Ligand-gated ion chanel
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Open when ligand binds
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}}
\ex{How G-protein-coupled receptor's work.}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ligand (signal) attaches to GPCR protein (receptor) in the cellular membrane
	\item G protein (bound to the GPCR) becomes activated and moves to the inactive enzyme
	\item The previously inactive enzyme is now activated and produces the specific protein (cellular response).
\end{enumerate}}
\nt{Ligand Gated Ion Channels use channel proteins and are thus passive transport. They only use high $\rightarrow$ low gradients.}
\nt{\textbf{Intracellular Receptors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Most ligands are large and water-soluble and must bind to membrane proteins.
	\item Other ligands are hydrophobic and enter the cell (such as steroids)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item They bind to intracellular receptors
	\end{itemize}
	\item They \textit{usually} are hormones.
	\item They \textit{usually} activate genes.
\end{itemize}}

\dfn{Transduction}{Transduction of a signal is a multistep pathway (signal transduction pathway.)
\nt{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Advantages:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Can amplify a signal.
		\item Provide more opportunities for coordination and regulation
	\end{itemize}
	\item The signal is passed by proteins changing shape (usually due to phosphorylation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Phosporylation = adding a P$_{i}$ (from ATP)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}}
\nt{In this process;
\begin{itemize}
	\item A series of protein kinases add a phosphate to the next one in line, activating it
	\item Phosphatase enzymes then remove the phosphates (called protein phosphatases)
	\item Or in other words, 1 activates 2 which activates 3 which activates 4 until the response is made.
	\item Kinase's are called such because they \textit{phosphorylate} other molecules, not because they become phosphorylated.
\end{itemize}}

\dfn{Second Messengers}{Small, nonprotein, water-soluble molecules or ions that activate proteins inside of a cell.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Most common second messengers are cAMP and Ca$^{2+}$
	\item These are the things that start the cascade
\end{itemize}}

\nt{Response:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Activate/Deactivate an enzyme in the cytoplasm
    \item Turn on/off genes in the nucleus
\end{enumerate}}

\qs{Why so many steps?}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Amplification.
	\item Specificity.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A cell will only respond if it has the right receptor.
		\item A ligand MAY be able to bind to two different receptors made by two different cells.
		\item There, however, you would get two different responses.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
}
\nt{When the ligand leaves the receptor, the pathway stops. The signal response is terminated somewhat quickly.}

\nt{Feedbacks;
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Positive Feedback
	\begin{itemize}
		\item When the reaction enhances the original stimulus
		\item Amplification
		\item An end
	\end{itemize}
	\item Negative Feedback
	\begin{itemize}
		\item When the reaction counters the original stimulus
		\item Keep things in a narrow range.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}}

\section{The Cell Cycle}

\dfn{Phases:}{Interphase:G1, S, G2 | Mitosis.
Interphase:

	\end{enumerate}
	\item Sister Chromatids
	\begin{enumerate}

	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
}
\dfn{Centromere}{The protein that holds the chromosomes together in the center.}
\nt{To count the number of chromosomes, you count the number of centromeres. \textbf{This is HUGE for the next few chapters. Remember this.}}

\dfn{Prophase}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Centrosomes move to opposite ends
	\item Chromatin coils up and can be seen as chromosomes
	\item Nucleoli disappears.
\end{enumerate}
}
\dfn{Prometaphase/Prophase Part 2}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Nuclear membrane completely disappears.
	\item Kinetochores start to form
	\item Spindle (bunch of microtubules) forms.
	\item Short microtubules form between centrosomes and cell membrane and form asters.
	\item More microtubules extend and connect to microtubules from other centrosome. (called non-kinetichore microtubules)
	\item And even more microtubules extend and connect to the kinetochore of each sister chromatid. (called kinetichore microtubules.)
\end{enumerate}
}
\dfn{Metaphase}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate (middle)
	\item Centrosomes are at opposite ends.
\end{enumerate}
}
\dfn{Anaphase}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item An enzyme breaks own the centromere
	\item Each chromatid is now a chromosome.\\
	So how many chromosomes do you have?: 92.
\end{enumerate}
}
\dfn{Telophase}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Chromosomes uncoil back into chromatin
	\item New nuclear membrane forms around each set.
	\item Cytokinesis: The dividing of the cytoplasm
\end{enumerate}
}

\nt{Bacteria reproduce via binary fission, it occurs simultaneously with DNA replication. Also, as DNA replicates, the bacteria elongates and pinches in.}

\nt{Checkpoints}{The cell cycle is controlled at various checkpoints along the way. Checkpoints are controlled by proteins.}
\dfn{Checkpoints}{
	The cell cycle is controlled at various checkpoints along the way. Checkpoints are controlled by proteins.
	There is one checkpoint for every phase of the cell cycle.
Examples:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item G0
	\item S
	\item M
\end{enumerate}
}
\dfn{Nondividing cells}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Enter G0
	\item Brain Cells
\end{enumerate}
}

\nt{Terms to Know}{
Kinases:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Enzymes that activate or inactivate other proteins by phosphorylating them.
	\end{enumerate}
Cdks:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Cyclin Dependent Kinases
		\item Their concentration stays the same throughout the cycle
		\item Whether they work or not is dependent on cyclins.
		If there are no cyclins, the Cdks do not function.
		\item When a cyclin attaches to a Cdk, the Cdk activates proteins needed in the cell cycle.
		\item Ex; MPF (sends the cell into mitosis)
	\end{enumerate}
Cyclins:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Proteins that activate Cdks by attaching to them
		\item Their concentrations fluctuate throughout the cycle.
		\item There's more thna one cyclin.
		\item There are internal and external signals that control cyclins.
	\end{enumerate}
}

\dfn{Density Dependent Inhibition}{
Also known as contact inhibition,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Cells stop dividing when they "bump into each other"
		\item Proteins from each cell's membrane bind together. They then change shape and prevent that protein from starting a pathway that leads to cell division.
	\end{enumerate}
}

\dfn{Anchorage Dependence}{
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Dividing cells need to be attached to something, like an extracellular matrix.
	\end{enumerate}
}

\dfn{Cancer}{
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Uncontrolled Cell division
		\item Cancerous Cells don't respond to checkpoints
		\item Think of it like a car speeding out of control.
	\end{enumerate}
}

\dfn{Oncogenes}{
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The mutated form of a gene that controlls the cell cycle, and can therefore cause a cell to become cancerous.
	\end{enumerate}
}

\dfn{Proto-Oncogenes}{
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The normal version of an oncogene.
		\item Positive growth regulators (cause division)
		\item Only one of the two copies you have has to go bad.
		\item Think of it as the accelerator getting stuck down.
	\end{enumerate}
}

\dfn{Tumor Suppressor Genes}{
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Negative growth regulators (inhibit division)
		\item Both copies have to go bad. (basically your pedal and emergency brakes fail)
		\item Different kinds:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Caretaker
			\item Gatekeeper
			\item Landscaper
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
}

\dfn{Caretaker Genes}{
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Involved in teh stability of DNA
		\item They fix it in some way
		\item Ex: BRCA1 (Breast cancer gene)
		\item The mutated BRACA1 and/or BRACA2 genes cannot repair DNA, and therefore allows cells to become cancerous.
		(so the normal forms of the genes are tumor suppressed genes.)
	\end{enumerate}
