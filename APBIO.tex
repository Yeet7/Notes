\chapter{4: Cellular Communication}\label{ch:Cellular Comm.}

Cells must talk	to each other. They do this via signals or messengers, these are called ligands. Ligands is a general term for any signaling molecule.
Molecules made by some cells have an affect on others. For example, neurotransmitters communicate from one neuron to the next nerve cell or even muscle cell.
Cells in the immune system will either communicate with each other to help fight off an infection or cause an infected or cancerous cell to kill itself.
\qs{Whats the point?}{}
Recieving cells have proteins embedded in their membranes. These are called receptor proteins.

\section{Reception}\label{sec:reception}
\nt{The binding between signal molecule (ligand) and receptor is highly specific.}
\dfn{Conformational Change}{The process by which a protein changes shape via something attaching to said protein.}
\nt{There are two main types of membrane receptors.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item G-protein-coupled receptor
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Works with a G-protein (protein that turns on and off enzymes)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Ligand-gated ion chanel
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Open when ligand binds
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}}
\ex{How G-protein-coupled receptor's work.}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ligand (signal) attaches to GPCR protein (receptor) in the cellular membrane
	\item G protein (bound to the GPCR) becomes activated and moves to the inactive enzyme
	\item The previously inactive enzyme is now activated and produces the specific protein (cellular response).
\end{enumerate}}
\nt{Ligand Gated Ion Channels use channel proteins and are thus passive transport. They only use high $\rightarrow$ low gradients.}
\nt{\textbf{Intracellular Receptors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Most ligands are large and water-soluble and must bind to membrane proteins.
	\item Other ligands are hydrophobic and enter the cell (such as steroids)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item They bind to intracellular receptors
	\end{itemize}
	\item They \textit{usually} are hormones.
	\item They \textit{usually} activate genes.
\end{itemize}}
